# Designing a Custom AXI Slave Peripheral
A guide to creating custom AXI-lite slave peripherals using the Xilinx Vivado tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an application note for users wishing to design their own AXI4-lite slave peripherals in Xilinx embedded processor systems.

This version of the application note was written for the [Xilinx Zynq-7000 devices](http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000/silicon-devices.html), using the the [Avnet ZedBoard](http://www.zedboard.org).  This information is equally applicable to other Xilinx boards and architectures where the AXI4 interconnect is used.

The provided example code was written for the [Xilinx Vivado tools](http://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).
